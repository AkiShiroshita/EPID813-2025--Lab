# Welcome!

This website is a collection of lab materials for the EPID8313 course (2025). The labs are designed to help you practice and apply the concepts covered in the course.

During each lab session (typically held before the journal club), I will address your specific questions using the resources provided here. To allow sufficient preparation time, please submit your questions at least one day in advance. If no questions are submitted, I will review the core concepts of the lab material for about 10â€“15 minutes before transitioning to the journal club.

For the journal club, you should prepare several slides summarizing the assigned articles. Each presentation will typically take around 15 minutes per article.
