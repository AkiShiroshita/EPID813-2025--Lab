# Comments on the assignment 1

* I prefer to provide a simple framework and/or figures alongside the text.

Q1: the PECO format

Q3: subject selection flow

Q6: DAG

* Information bias

Measurement error: mismeasurment of continuous variables

Misclassification: inaccuracy of categorical variables (sometimes, this is called "information bias")

# DAG may help understand the bias

* Selection bias

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/dag1.png")
```

* Misclassification (Differentiality vs. Dependence)

### Differentiality

Nondifferential: Sensitivity and specificity are independent of another key variable

vs. 

Differential: Sensitivity and specificity are not independent of another key variable

### Dependence

Independent: Misclassification of one variable does not change the probability that subjects will be misclassified on a second variable

vs. 

Dependent: The probability of being doubly misclassified is not equal to the product of the probabilities of being singly misclassified with respect to exposure and outcome. (e.g., sensitivity of exposure misclassification is correlated with sensitivity of outcome misclassification)
