The labs are designed to help you practice and apply the concepts learned in the course.\nDuring the lab session (usually, prior to the journal club), I will address your specific questions using the resources on this website. To ensure I can prepare the necessary materials, please post your questions at least one day in advance. If no questions are posted, I may skip the lab session and proceed directly to the journal club.\nFor the journal club, you may prepare several slides summarizing the assigned articles. Since these articles serve as important references rather than original studies for critique, focusing on sharing their core concepts would be most valuable.\n\n\nInstroctor\n\nAki Shiroshita, MD, MPH\n4th-year Epidemiology PhD student\nOriginally from Japan\nFulbright grantee\nResearch interest: Environmental epidemiology, pharmacoepidemiology\n\n\n\nRaffle\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",
