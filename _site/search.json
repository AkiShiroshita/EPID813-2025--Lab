The labs are designed to help you practice and apply the concepts covered in the course.\nDuring each lab session (typically held before the journal club), I will address your specific questions using the resources provided here. To allow sufficient preparation time, please submit your questions at least one day in advance. If no questions are submitted, I will review the core concepts of the lab material for about 10–15 minutes before transitioning to the journal club.\nFor the journal club, you should prepare several slides summarizing the assigned articles. Each presentation will typically take around 15 minutes per article.\n\n\nInstroctor\n\nAki Shiroshita, MD, MPH\n4th-year Epidemiology PhD student\nOriginally from Japan\nFulbright grantee\nResearch interest: Environmental epidemiology, pharmacoepidemiology\nDissertation: Traffic-related environmental exposures during early life and adverse health outcomes",
