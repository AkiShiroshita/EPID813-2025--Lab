The labs are designed to help you practice and apply the concepts learned in the course.\nDuring the lab session (usually, prior to the journal club), I will address your specific questions using the resources on this website. To ensure I can prepare the necessary materials, please post your questions at least one day in advance. If no questions are posted, I may skip the lab session and proceed directly to the journal club.\nFor the jounal club, you may prepare a few slides summarizing the assigned articles. Since these articles serve as important references rather than original studies for critique, focusing on sharing their core concepts would be most valuable.",
